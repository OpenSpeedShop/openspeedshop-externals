Please see the BuildInstallGuide.txt for the latest build
and install information.  That document is based on the "pdf" version 
of the Build and Install Guide that is available in the Files download 
area for this OpenSpeedShop release on sourceforge.

Both documents have valid Open|SpeedShop-2.3 release information, but the
format is better in the pdf.

See the laptop_build.sh file for an example of a typical laptop/cluster build.
